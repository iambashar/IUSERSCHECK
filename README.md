# IUSERSCHECK

Hello good people.

The Project will help you a lot, if you are an IUTIAN & most importantly Residential Student.

Do you ever lose your pocket allowance for the overtime bill of IUT's Internet Service?
If not, then you are lucky, but most people often have to face this situation.
The situation is even more painful if one of your roommates' minutes are free, but your
pocket allowance ends up deducted.

So I came up with a solution for this problem.

What if, you don't check your usage regularly yourself, but let a silly script do that for you?
This is what I made for you guys. This python script will do this task for you.

## Usage

You have to do only 3 tasks & Forget about everything else.

1. Download the zip file from releases & unzip it & store in a permanent folder
2. Open the "idpass.txt", in this file store your userid & password in the format shown 
(At first delete the line give as an example) & close it after save
3. Just click on the FirstTime.exe and boom

Attention: When your usage will cross the limit 5800 minutes then the next userid will be connected on the router automatically.

Also, as of right now, this script is still a WIP (and therefore very unpolished, so expect many changes to the script in the near future. (GUI coming soon xD)

**Disclaimer: The Code has still now few of bugs, so this isn't working properly right now. Use at your own risk.**
