# IUSERSCHECK

Hello good people.

The Project will help you a lot, if you are an IUTIAN & most importantly Residential Student.

Do you ever lose your pocket allowance for the overtime bill of IUT's Internet Service?
If not, then you are lucky, but most people often have to face this situation.
The situation is even more painful if one of your roommates' minutes are free, but your
pocket allowance ends up deducted.

So I came up with a solution for this problem.

What if, you don't check your usage regularly yourself, but let a silly script do that for you?
This is what I made for you guys. This python script will do this task for you.

## Usage

Just open the "idpass.txt" file & enter your four or more(:v) roommates userid & password & save it
Add "tool.vbs" to startup & restart your computer, That's all. Checking the log will give you more info
about your usage.

You have to do only 3 tasks & Forget about everything else.

1. Download the zip file from releases & unzip it & store in a permanent folder
2. Open the "idpass.txt", in this file store your userid & password in the format shown 
(At first delete the line give as an example) & close it after save
3. Press "Windows+R" type `shell:startup` Create a "New Shortcut", give the path of `tool.vbs` from your folder, 
Click next next When all is ok, Then restart your PC, & forget about to check your usage.

Attention: When your usage will cross the limit 5800 minutes then your IUSERS password will be automatically changed to `1234` so that your router can't connect to internet
by your password. So when you see that your router can't connect to internet then you are assuered that you pass the limit of 5800 minutes & also your
password is now `1234`

NB: Unfortunately the "lib" folder can't be uploaded in git, so you find it in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zFVP5WjEq9ixa9xNZkKyFcQHM9pxywh6?usp=sharing

Also, as of right now, this script is still a WIP (and therefore very unpolished, so expect many changes to the script in the near future. (GUI coming soon xD)

If you like the project please keep supporting me.
