Hello good people.

The Project will help a lot to you, if you are an IUTIAN & most importantly Residential Student.

Don't you ever loose your pocket allowance for the bill of Hall Internet?
If not, then you are lucky, But most of the people must have to face this situation.
The situation is more painful if one of your room mates minute is remaining, but your's
pocket allowence is deducted.

So I come up with a solution for this kind of problem.

What if, you don't need to check your usage regularly, a silly script will do that for you?
This is what I made for you guys. So my python script will do this task for you.

Just open the "idpass.txt" file & edit your four or more(:v) roomemates userid & password & save it
Add "tool.vbs" to startup & restart your computer, That's all. Checking the log will give you more info
about your usage.

At this point if you are bored a lot but can't get anything from the above text just skip it, and follow from below

You have to do only 3 tasks & Froget about allthing.

Step 1 :-> Download the git in zip format & unzip it & store in a permanant folder
Step 2 :-> Open the "idpass.txt", in this file store yours userid & password as shown format(At first delete all thing gives as example) & close it after save
Step 3 :-> Press"Windows+R" type "shell:startup" Craete a "New Shortcut", give the path of "tool.vbs" from your folder, Click next next
		   When all is ok, Then resatrt you PC, & forget about to check your usage.
Attention: When your usage will cross the limit 5800 minutes then your password will automatically changed to "1234" sothat your router can't connect to internet
		   by your password. So when you see that your router can't connect to internet then you are assuered that you pass the limmit of 5800 minutes & also your
		   password is now "1234"
NB: Unfortunately the "lib" folder can't be uploaded in git, so you find it in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zFVP5WjEq9ixa9xNZkKyFcQHM9pxywh6?usp=sharing
download it from driev and add to master IUSERCHECK folder

If you like the project please keep supporting me.
